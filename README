This version of pianobar automatically uploads artist and title to your mysql database.
As of right now, the database is named pianobar and the table is named Playlist; however, these will be added to the config file options later.

The options for mysql username and password can be added into your ~/.config/pianobar/config file. example:

# This is an example configuration file for pianobar. You may remove the # from
# lines you need and copy/move this file to ~/.config/pianobar/config
# See manpage for a description of the config keys
